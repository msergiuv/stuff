> Virtual database<br/>

A virtual database (or VDB) is a container for components used to integrate data from multiple data sources, so that they can be accessed in an integrated manner through a single, uniform API. A VDB contains models, which define the structural characteristics of data sources, views, and Web services.
 A virtual database's goal is to be able to view and access data in a unified way without needing to copy and duplicate it in several databases or manually combine the results from many queries.
Virtual databases are also known as federated databases.
