> **Definition:** <br/>
Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. Each organization is comprised of one (or more) workstations, a single server, and every node that will be configured and maintained by the chef-client. Cookbooks (and recipes) are used to tell the chef-client how each node in your organization should be configured. The chef-client (which is installed on every node) does the actual configuration.

*Install the Chef client on every node you want to manage with Chef. The Chef client and the Chef server work together to bring nodes to their desired states using policies you provide as recipes.*

Example for node that runs on ubuntu:

1. run the following command in the shell (or install manually the package):

	`curl -L https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh | sudo bash`
